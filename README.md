**Problem:
**
Over 3147 people (1391-Male, 1756-Female) all around the world have died in 2020 due to skin related diseases. 455 people out of 100,000 are living with skin diseases in India according to WHO & IJDVL census. It takes a Physician, a family doctor, a specialist and a chief doctor to diagnose a skin disease and make a critical decision about the treatment process. It is important for a Doctor to spend enough time on a patient’s diagnosis as it decides the course of treatment.The prevalence of skin diseases in the general population in different geographic regions of India varies from 7.9% to 60%.This ratio is increasing as the skin diseases are not considered seriously and handled very recklessly by people. People are too lazy to go visit a doctor until and unless it becomes something serious. Diseases like Psoriasis first start like a small rash and can be treated and cured if found in an early stage whereas delaying makes it deadly. People are sometimes embarrassed to talk about their symptoms in front of their doctors or to any of their close ones. Online cosmetic product shopping and skin care doesn’t provide any closure and is a one fit for all solution. Skin care and Dermatology demands personalised care and customised products in today’s world. The aim is to build a solution that covers all of the above said problems. The skincare industry is constantly evolving, with increasing demand for personalised products and services. Manual skin diagnosis and product selection can be subjective and time-consuming. By combining wood light examination, which reveals hidden skin conditions, with ML algorithms, this project addresses these challenges and offers an automated, accurate, and efficient solution for skincare diagnosis, product recommendations, and customer segmentation. Cutis Care aims to address these problems by providing an all in one solution for the field of dermatology from automating skin disease diagnosis, insect bite analysis to customising cosmetic products. The idea aims to revolutionise the skincare industry by leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance skin diagnosis, recommend appropriate cosmetic products, and segment customers based on their skin characteristics. The project integrates technologies to provide personalised skincare solutions, optimise customer experience, and contribute to the growth of the beauty and wellness sector.

The solution includes a multimodal diagnostic approach combining dermatological diagnosis- wood light examination used by dermatologists, which reveals fluorescence patterns in the skin, with a cosmetic shade finder using machine learning, which analyses skin colour variations. This combination provides a more comprehensive and holistic assessment of skin conditions. Both wood light examination and shade finder analysis are non-invasive and quick procedures. This makes them well-suited for efficient and comfortable skin assessments, reducing patient discomfort and apprehension. Machine learning algorithms bring objectivity and quantification to skin disease diagnosis. By analysing fluorescence patterns and color shades, the system can provide the health report and insights, reducing the potential for subjective interpretations. The integration of wood light examination and machine learning enables the detection of subtle patterns and colour variations that may not be easily discernible by the human eye alone. This heightened sensitivity enhances diagnostic accuracy. The combined approach is not limited to a specific subset of skin diseases. It can potentially identify a wide range of conditions, from pigmentary disorders to infections and inflammatory diseases. The unique approach supports a patient-centric approach to dermatology. It empowers dermatologists to make well-informed decisions based on comprehensive data, leading to more personalized and effective treatment plans. It also ensures customer satisfaction by providing tailored and custom diagnosis and treatment plans. The technology can potentially be integrated into telemedicine platforms, allowing patients in remote areas to receive accurate skin disease assessments without the need for in-person visits. The integration of traditional dermatological techniques with cutting-edge technology exemplifies the synergy between medical expertise and artificial intelligence, paving the way for the evolution of dermatological practice.
